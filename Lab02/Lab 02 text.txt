Using C programming to write the following program:
1. Declare and assign the value for 2 variables int a =5 and int b = 10. Then print the value of a
and b.
2. Create two variables, num1 set to 10, and num2 set to 30. Proceed to add these two
variables together and display the result
3. Initialize three variables: num1 with a value of 20.5, num2 with a value of 30.2, and
num3 with a value of 50. Perform the summation of these three variables and display
the result.

4. Declare two variables name and age then assign your name and age to the variables.
Finally, display name and age respectively.
5. Declare 3 variables name, institute and a major; assign the value to variable. Then, display
the following message: 'Hello, I am [name]. I am studying [major] at [institute/university].
6. Declare two integers variables 'a' and 'b' then assign the value 100 and 5 respectively.
Perform arithmetic operations (+,-, *. /) using these variables, and then print the result along
with the details of the operation used.
7. Declare 2 variables width and height of a rectangle; assign the value of width and
height. Calculate the area of the rectangle and provide a detailed explanation of the
operation.
8. Declare one variable radius of a circle; assign the value of radius. Calculate the perimeter
(circumference) of the circle and display the result.

9. Prompt the user to input their age and height. Store the entered values in variables
named 'age' and 'height', respectively. Finally, display the values of 'age' and 'height'
back to the screen.
10. prompts the user to input two integers, assigning them to variables 'a' and 'b' respectively.
Perform arithmetic operations (+,-, *, /) using these variables, and then print the result along
with the details of the operation used.
GOOD LUCK!
